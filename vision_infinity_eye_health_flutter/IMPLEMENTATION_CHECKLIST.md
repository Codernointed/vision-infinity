# Vision∞ Flutter Implementation Checklist

## Overview 🌟

This implementation checklist guides the migration of Vision∞ from Next.js to Flutter while maintaining exact feature parity and visual fidelity. The reference Next.js project is located at `vision-infinity-eye-health/` and serves as the source of truth for our Flutter implementation.

### Project Description
Vision∞ is an AI-powered eye health screening app that enables users to:
- Scan eyes using smartphone camera
- Receive instant AI-powered analysis
- View detailed health recommendations
- Access professional-grade diagnostics

### Key Features
- **Simplified Mode**: Quick diagnosis for basic users
  - Symptom identification
  - Disease detection
  - AI recommendations
- **Advanced Mode**: Professional healthcare features
  - In-depth analysis
  - Lesion detection
  - Predictive scoring
  - PDF report generation
- **Privacy-First**: Local data storage with optional cloud sync

### Next.js to Flutter Migration Rules
1. **Directory Structure Mapping**:
   ```
   Next.js                 Flutter
   ├── app/               ├── lib/
   ├── components/        │   ├── widgets/
   ├── styles/           │   ├── core/theme/
   ├── hooks/            │   ├── core/hooks/
   ├── public/           │   ├── assets/
   └── lib/              │   └── core/utils/
   ```

2. **Component Translation**:
   - Each React component should have a corresponding Flutter widget
   - Maintain component hierarchy and composition
   - Preserve component props as widget parameters
   - Keep styling and layout consistent

3. **State Management**:
   - Convert React hooks to Riverpod providers
   - Maintain global state architecture
   - Preserve state update patterns
   - Keep state immutability

4. **Navigation**:
   - Map Next.js routes to GoRouter configuration
   - Preserve route parameters and queries
   - Maintain navigation history
   - Keep route protection logic
